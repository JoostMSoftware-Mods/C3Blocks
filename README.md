# C3 Blocks

Compacted, Condensed, Compressed blocks aka C3 Blocks. 

## Goal

The goal of C3 Blocks is to make a fully customisable experience when getting compressed blocks and normally the people who want compressed blocks are mostly limited to only vanilla.
This mod basically clears that to make it fully up to the user how they want the compressed blocks to go. 

Don't want x vanilla block? Just remove it from the config. <br />
Want to add a modded block? Just add it to the config.

The config is made to the user experience in mind which is why it's created in the first place.
